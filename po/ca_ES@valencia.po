"The time had come for Amailoss, the naga queen's youngest hatchling, to "
"leave home. Time for him to grow into a leader in his own right, and "
"eventually become the guardian and leader of some other naga community. But "
"during their travels, Amailoss and his companions befriended a strange young "
"monster, they met an unusual mud-crawler, discovered that a spirit had "
"escaped from an orc prison, and the mystery of that spirit became a grave "
"challenge for Amailoss and the many races in the region....\n"

"This is a naga campaign, involving elves, orcs, saurians, an interesting "

"epilogue. All scenarios are here and playable and reasonably well balanced. "
"A few bugs may still be present. Feedback on all aspects of the campaign "

"Snow fairies have haunted the highlands of Wesnoth for centuries, preferring "

"underground mushrooms that are normally only seen by dwarves and trolls.\n"
"Snow fairies are powerful, ethereal, and elusive; even dwarvish wardens and "
"the highest-flying drakes rarely encounter them. They harness the elemental "
"power of the mountains to work their magic, suddenly animating the wiry "
"highland plants to entangle an unsuspecting target, or assailing their foes "
